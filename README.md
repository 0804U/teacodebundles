# TeaCode Bundles

This repo includes my bundles and a markdown version of them.

**NOTE: Requires Python 3+**

To create your own:

1. clone this repo and delete all files except `.gitignore` and `autogeneratemd.py`. 
3. Run `python autogeneratemd.py`.

`autogeneratemd.py` generates it's previews from the description field on expanders. Therefore, to include an example showing the syntax and output requires including an example in the description field.
